#set:lower_bound:
Iterator pointing to the first element that is not less than key.
If no such element is found, a past-the-end iterator is returned.
O(logarithmic)

#set:upper_bound:
Iterator pointing to the first element that is greater than key.
If no such element is found, past-the-end (see end()) iterator is returned.
O(logarithmic)

#std::find :
